# CTR_Prediction_Analysis

* Most of the websites we visit include ads. The online advertising industry is huge, and players such as Google, 
Amazon, and Facebook generate billions of dollars by targeting the correct audiences with relevant ads. Most of 
the decisions about ads are data-driven solutions.
* As part of this assignment, we are required to predict whether a user will click on an ad or not using classification 
models as they are best suited here.
* An important exercise marketing companies need to do before making any of the above decisions is a click-through rate (CTR) prediction. The objective is to predict whether the audience will click on an ad or not and 
thus help the marketing team answer ad placement-related questions
